        <h1>Week 01</h1>
        <p>I just finished watching the weekly office hour meeting. I attended all but the last 10
            minutes. That was were Bro. Thayne told us to add our notes and comments here to submit
            them.</p>
        <p>I did struggle in getting everything working correctly using Git and GitHumb. I'm
            hoping it is working correctly. If not, I will be adding some additional comments to
            explain what else I did. I have include the notes I submitted earlier below. I
            don't have any additional code to add at this time.</p>
        <p>This is an interesting assignment. I’m not really sure what kind of notes it include here.
            I’m sure I will be refining this every week. I don’t know what code to include this week,
            since it’s the first week and this assignment is due prior to any code writing. Again,
            there will be some revisions to how I will be submitting this assignment for future weeks.</p>
        <p>The Master Mobile UX video series was very interesting and useful. I loved the analogy of
            shoving a marshmallow into a piggybank. There were many things discussed that I had never
            really thought about. The mobile trends are almost unbelievable. With the large number
            of mobile users and the way they are using their devices designing for mobile first makes
            complete sense. I wish I would have had this outlook prior to taking CS 213 Web
            Engineering I. I think things would have gone a little smother.</p>
        <p>I learned more about how to use VS Code during the first Office Hours class meeting than I
            did the entire last semester. I will definitely need to go back and watch the recording
            again. I am looking forward to the weekly meetings.</p>
