Well, that worked pretty good.  The apostrophes seem to not work to well.  I will test to see if I can get them to show.

Test:
I\'ll see if the apostrophe is or is\'nt here.

If it\'s there, than using the backslach worked.  If not, then I\'ll have to see how to make it work.  For now, that\'s good enough.  I need to work on my Todo project now.

Ha! It looks like the question marks in the black diamond are a remnant of saving my Word doc.  The apostrophes seem to work without the backslash.  So I don't need to add it after all.  Whew!!!
