        <p class="font-wht">This week has flown by.  I did, however, finally gain a better 
            understanding of what I should be putting in this portfolio.  With that being said, 
            I didn't get a lot accomplished here.  I spent almost all day in the ER with my son 
            and did not accomplish what I set out this morning to do.  That's what happens when 
            you wait until the last day to work on things.  I know this.
        </p>
        <p class="font-wht">I plan to add more for my reading notes, but that will happen after 
            this week's grading.  I will plan to add code snipets, but that will have to happen 
            next week.
        </p>
        <p class="font-wht">I will also be cleaing up my layout and standardizing the formatting.  
            This will take place over time.
