First off, I am trying something new.  I am embedding my notes this week to see if I can do it.  If you’re reading this, then it worked!  I am very slowly starting to get things organized.  I’m not as far along on my project as I would like to be, but I am working on it.
Some of my reading notes.  I’m sure I will have to reformat this a few times.  I don’t think I can simply copy and paste my Word doc as a text file and have it work.  Who knows?
